- Typical zkrollups consist of two contracts - main contract and verifier contract
- Main contract stores rollup blocks, monitors the blockchain state and tracks fund deposits and withdrawals
- Verifier contract authenticates zero knowledge proofs submitted to the base layer
- An offchain virtual machine occupies the second layer of zkRollups
- An operator contract and super node is part of the architecture
- There could be a single operator or a set of validators
